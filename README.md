# Tasks

## Task 1: Examine Conditions
**Objective:** Practice conditional statements in JavaScript.
- Create a program that prompts the user for their age.
- Use a conditional statement to check if the age is less than 18.
- If the age is less than 18, display a message saying `"You are a minor."` Otherwise, display `"You are an adult."`


## Task 2: Sort Variables
**Objective:** Use conditional statements to sort variables.
- Create three variables: `a`, `b`, and `c` and assign numeric values to them.
- Use conditional statements to arrange these variables in ascending order (from small to big).
- Display the sorted values in the console.


## Task 3: Array Operations
**Objective:** Practice array manipulation and operations in JavaScript
- Create an array named `numbers` and initialize it with a sequence of numbers (e.g., `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`).
- Use a `for` **loop** to create a new array named `squaredNumbers`. In this new array, each element should be the square of the corresponding element in the `numbers` array.
- Use another `for` **loop** to find the maximum value in the `numbers` array and store it in a variable called `maxValue`.
- Use yet another `for` **loop** to find the minimum value in the numbers array and store it in a variable called `minValue`.
- Display the `squaredNumbers` array, `maxValue`, and `minValue` in the console.
